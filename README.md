Note: It helps to alias these things in ~/.bashrc -- I use "newsh" and "newpy" respectively

# ws.sh
This is a simple shellscript that takes a filename as an argument, changes it to executable, and opens it up in vim.
Used to speed up my workflow a touch.

# pyth.sh
This is a simple shellscript that takes a filename as an argument, creates a file with that name containing "#!/bin/python3" as the first line, and opens it in vim
